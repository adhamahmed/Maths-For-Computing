# Assignment 1

### Part 1
 a) A small local catering company provides hot dogs served in buns at local events. The owner has to order the hot dogs and the buns and wants to ensure that however many are ordered, there are the same number of hot dogs and buns. The hot dogs usually come in packages of 8 although this can vary depending on the supplier. The buns usally come in packages of 12 but like the buns this can vary.
 
The owner would like an app that will determine the appropriate number of packages of hot dogs and buns to order, given:
* a specified minimum number of servings that must be catered for
* the number of items per package, if different from usual

b) At weekends there are often two events. The owner packs the buns into plastic containers. Each container has the same number of buns. If 288 buns are needed for one event and 660 buns are needed for another, determine the maximum number of buns per container so that a whole number of container can be taken to each event.

### Part 2
a) You have decided to save some money during the six week holiday. You save 1p on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the second day, etc. How much will you have at the end of the holiday (42 days)?

For this arithmetic sequence, this formula needs to be used, where n is 42 for the number of days/number of terms in the series, and a is 1 for the first number in our series

Once calculated, the answer comes to 903, which works out to be Â£9.03 saved after the holiday.




b) A friend of yours runs a charity marathon. He manages to run the first mile in 6 minutes but takes 5% longer for each subsequent mile of the 26 mile race. How long does it take him to complete the race?

### Part 3
Find a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 of each of the following integers.

(a) 1

1 x 0 = 0  r0

1 x 1 = 1  r1

Answer is 1

(b) 5

5 x 0 = 0  r0

5 x 1 = 5  r5

5 x 2 = 10  r1

Answer is 2

(c) 7

7 x 0 = 0  r0

7 x 1 = 7  r7

7 x 2 = 14  r5

7 x 3 = 21  r3

7 x 4 = 28  r1

Answer is 4

(d) 16

16 x 0 = 0  r1

16 x 1 = 16  r7

16 x 2 = 32  r5

16 x 3 = 48  r3

16 x 4 = 64  r1

Answer is 4

Show that each of the following integers doesn't have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9.

(a) 0

0 cannot have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as anything times 0 will always result in 0 and remainder 1 cannot be found.

(b) 6

6 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as the numbers 6 and 9 both share a common prime factor - 3.

(c) 18

18 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as the numbers 18 and 9 both share common prime factors - 2 and 3.


### Part 4
Produce a detailed report, explaining the importance of prime numbers within the field of computing.
