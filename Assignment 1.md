# Assignment 1

### Part 1
 a) A small local catering company provides hot dogs served in buns at local events. The owner has to order the hot dogs and the buns and wants to ensure that however many are ordered, there are the same number of hot dogs and buns. The hot dogs usually come in packages of 8 although this can vary depending on the supplier. The buns usally come in packages of 12 but like the buns this can vary.
 
The owner would like an app that will determine the appropriate number of packages of hot dogs and buns to order, given:
* a specified minimum number of servings that must be catered for
* the number of items per package, if different from usual

Using Euclid's Algorithm in code looks as such:

int a,b,c;

cout << "Please enter the number of hot dogs that come in a single package: ";

cin >> a; 

cout << "Please enter the number of buns that come in a single package: ";

cin >> b;

c=a*b; 

while(a!=b) { 

    if(a>b) 
    
	a=a-b; 
	
    else 
    
	b=b-a; 
	
}

cout << "The minimum number of items per package if different from usual is " << a << endl; 

cout << "The minimum number of servings that must be catered for is " << c/a << endl;

By using this code, we can find out the minimum number of servings must be 24 by working out the LCM of 8 and 12.

To work out the second part, which asks for the number of items per package if different from usual, the HCF of 8 and 12 has to be calculated. The HCF of 8 and 12 is 4, so the appropriate number of items per package if different from usual would be 4.


b) At weekends there are often two events. The owner packs the buns into plastic containers. Each container has the same number of buns. If 288 buns are needed for one event and 660 buns are needed for another, determine the maximum number of buns per container so that a whole number of container can be taken to each event.
(Use Euclid's Algorithm to find the HCF)

660 = (288 x 2) + 84
288 = (84 x 3) + 36
84 = (36 x 2) + 12
36 = (12 x 3) + 0

As the remainder has been reached, the HCF of 660 and 288 is 12.

### Part 2
a) You have decided to save some money during the six week holiday. You save 1p on the first day, 2p on the second day, 3p on the second day, etc. How much will you have at the end of the holiday (42 days)?

For this arithmetic sequence, this formula needs to be used, where n is 42 for the number of days/number of terms in the series, and a is 1 for the first number in our series

Once calculated, the answer comes to 903, which works out to be Â£9.03 saved after the holiday.



b) A friend of yours runs a charity marathon. He manages to run the first mile in 6 minutes but takes 5% longer for each subsequent mile of the 26 mile race. How long does it take him to complete the race? Give your answer to the nearest second.

First we must work out the amount of time taken to complete each mile of the race.
Since the first mile takes 6 minutes to complete and each subsequent mile takes another 5%, we can find a pattern:
Mile 1 - 6 minutes
Mile 2 - 6 x 1.05 minutes
Mile 3 - 6 x (1.05)^2 minutes

As we follow this pattern, the 26th mile should be:
Mile 26 - 6 x (1.05)^25 minutes

To work out the total time, we can put it into a formula that looks as such:

Once we put the numbers put into formula, it looks as such:

Once the numbers are in the formula, we can work out that it is 306.68.. minutes. To the nearest second, this is 18400 seconds.

### Part 3
Find a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 of each of the following integers.

(a) 1

1 x 0 = 0  r0

1 x 1 = 1  r1

Answer is 1

(b) 5

5 x 0 = 0  r0

5 x 1 = 5  r5

5 x 2 = 10  r1

Answer is 2

(c) 7

7 x 0 = 0  r0

7 x 1 = 7  r7

7 x 2 = 14  r5

7 x 3 = 21  r3

7 x 4 = 28  r1

Answer is 4

(d) 16

16 x 0 = 0  r1

16 x 1 = 16  r7

16 x 2 = 32  r5

16 x 3 = 48  r3

16 x 4 = 64  r1

Answer is 4

Show that each of the following integers doesn't have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9.

(a) 0

0 cannot have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as anything times 0 will always result in 0 and remainder 1 cannot be found.

(b) 6

6 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as the numbers 6 and 9 both share a common prime factor - 3.

(c) 18

18 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 9 as the numbers 18 and 9 both share common prime factors - 2 and 3.


### Part 4
Produce a detailed report, explaining the importance of prime numbers within the field of computing.
